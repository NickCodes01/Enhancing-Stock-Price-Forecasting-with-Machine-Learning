# Enhancing-Stock-Price-Forecasting-with-Machine-Learning
I developed a predictive model for stock market trends to assist in investment decision-making. The objective is to provide investors with accurate predictions that support proactive investment strategies, enabling investors to capitalize on emerging opportunities and mitigate risks efficiently. This initiative seeks to address the challenges presented by the complexity and uncertainty of the stock market.

To achieve accurate future stock price prediction, I employed a Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC), an ensemble method that sequentially builds decision trees in order to minimize prediction error and capture non-linear relationships. This algorithm combines multiple weak learners sequentially, where each decision tree corrects errors of the preceding tree, which enhances the predictive power of the model. 

The Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC) achieved an accuracy of 83% (overall correctness), precision of 71% (proportion of true positive predictions), recall of 100% (true positive predictions identified out of all actual positive instances) and an F1-score of 83% (balance between precision and recall) across 12 randomly selected publicly traded corporations. Intermediary results included the optimal combination of hyperparameters (learning_rate, max_depth, and n_estimators) according to each specific dataset.
